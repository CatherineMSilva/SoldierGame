# SoldierGame
This is a short program to showcase my understanding of object oriented code.
This "game" runs through many quick cycles of what we typically see in a battle style game. 
It consits of Homing, Patrolling, Attacking, Defending, and Retreating stages. 
Each of these stages indicates necessary information about both the "soldier" and the "enemy", allowing us to see the progression of health, 
damage, and changes in stages depending on these too. 

Just click run and watch those stages change.
